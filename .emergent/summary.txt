The trajectory details the AI engineer's transition from MVP to a more robust and feature-rich application. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes, specifically resolving a white screen error due to  initialization in  and repositioning the AI chat button. Subsequently, the AI engineer addressed several functional enhancements requested by the user, including enabling direct editing of solved failures, adding a status field to active failure edits, implementing a delete function for resolved failures, and integrating comprehensive Google Sheets export for all tables. A significant focus was also placed on refining the AI agent Jessica's behavior, ensuring she asks for the user's name and avoids fabricating information. The trajectory culminates in the initiation of a major architectural shift: implementing full user authentication and data isolation, with the frontend components completed and the extensive backend work currently pending user confirmation.

<product_requirements>
The Yahel - Naval Unit Management and Leadership Training System aims to be a comprehensive management tool for naval officers, integrating an AI leadership training agent, Jessica. Core requirements include unit management tables (Active Failures, Pending Maintenances, Component Hours & Treatments, Daily Work Plan, Solved Failures) and leadership training tables (Conversation Tracker, Yahel DNA Tracker, 90-Day Plan). Jessica, based on Quantum Weave principles, should read, write, and update records, and specifically ask How was it solved? for closed failures. The system requires full Hebrew RTL support, a dynamic dashboard, multi-line chat input, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration. Success metrics include a September 2025 readiness, saving 2-3 daily hours, fostering leadership identity, and high soldier satisfaction. So far, the application has progressed to include 10 tables, AI chat, Google Calendar integration, Push Notifications, and functionalities for editing failures, deleting solved failures, Google Sheets export, and partial user authentication.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Full-Stack architecture:



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Core backend for FastAPI endpoints, CRUD with MongoDB. Manages AI agent logic, Google Calendar integration, and Push Notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Fixed  to allow status updates.
        -   Added  endpoint.
        -   Modified Jessica's prompt to ask for user's name initially and avoid inventing information when data is missing.
        -   Added  class for data export.
        -   Implemented JWT authentication logic, including  and  models, , , and  functions.
        -   Updated  to return  instead of JSON.
        -   Updated  to create/update users in the new authentication system and issue JWT tokens.
        -   Fixed AI chat endpoints ( for POST, and new ,  for GET/DELETE respectively).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables like , , , Google API keys.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  and  for Google Sheets. Added  for JWT.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  for Google Sheets integration.  and  for JWT authentication.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: New file created to store Google Service Account credentials for Sheets API.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and populated with user-provided JSON key file content.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, structuring app layout, routing, global state, and rendering tabs/AI chat.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Fixed white screen error by reordering  state declaration before its  usage and removing duplicate state declarations.
        -   Relocated  (Jessica's shortcut) from  to .
        -   Implemented functionality to directly edit Solved Failures by adding a form state and  function.
        -   Added a status field to the active failures editing form.
        -   Integrated a delete button and  for Solved Failures.
        -   Added  function and  icon.
        -   Integrated Export to Sheets buttons into Active Failures, Solved Failures, Pending Maintenances, Equipment Hours, and Daily Work Plan tables. All remaining tables' export buttons were added in a bulk update.
        -   Fixed AI chat communication: changed API endpoint from  to  and changed parameter name from  to . Also updated  and  calls.
        -   Implemented frontend authentication: added a Login Screen, logic for storing/managing JWT tokens in localStorage, auto-redirect from Google OAuth callback, user management (logout), and sending authentication headers with all API calls. All app functionality is now gated behind authentication.
-   ** (e.g., FailuresTab.jsx, SolvedFailuresTab.jsx)**:
    -   **Summary**: Each file represents a specific tab/table view.
    -   **Changes Made**: The changes to enable editing of Solved Failures, adding status to Active Failures, delete buttons, and export buttons were mainly orchestrated from  affecting the rendering of these tabs.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of user isolation and authentication middleware across all backend API endpoints. This involves updating approximately 40 endpoints to enforce  filtering.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the critical process of implementing a comprehensive user authentication and data isolation system. The frontend portion of this system has been successfully completed. This includes a new login screen, robust JWT token management (storage in localStorage), automatic redirection from Google OAuth callback, user management functionalities (like logout), and the crucial addition of authentication headers to all API calls. Furthermore, the entire application's functionality is now gated, meaning users must be logged in to access features, and the AI chat (Jessica) only works for authenticated users. Data fetching on the frontend is now dependent on a successful authentication flow.

The next major phase of this work, which is currently pending, is to update the backend. This involves modifying all backend API endpoints (estimated 40+) to validate the authentication tokens, filter data based on the authenticated , and ensure that each user can only access and modify their own specific data. The AI engineer is currently poised to begin this extensive backend implementation and has asked the user for confirmation on the preferred approach (e.g., full implementation now, basic example, or deferral).
