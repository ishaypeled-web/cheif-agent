The AI engineer successfully took the Yahel - Naval Unit Management and Leadership Training System from initial development to an advanced MVP stage. The work primarily focused on expanding core functionalities and addressing critical user feedback. Key achievements include the full integration of Google Calendar for event management and a robust Push Notifications system, enhancing user engagement and utility. Significant effort was also put into improving UI/UX, specifically ensuring full Hebrew RTL support and mobile responsiveness for a seamless user experience across devices. Furthermore, the AI engineer diligently addressed several bugs, including a critical issue with editing existing entries across all tables and refining the AI agent Jessica's prompt logic for automated solved failures updates. The current task involves resolving a white screen error caused by an  initialization issue in the frontend. This iterative approach, combining feature development with continuous bug fixing and UI/UX improvements, has resulted in a comprehensive and functional application.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to create Yahel - Naval Unit Management and Leadership Training System, serving as a management tool for naval officers and a leadership training AI agent (Jessica) based on Quantum Weave principles.

**Core Requirements (Development Phases):**
1.  **Unit Management Tables (4 initial, expanding to 7+):**
    *   : Tracking, prioritization (1-5), alerts for old failures.
    *   : Automatic scheduling, colored alerts.
    *   : Calculate next treatment based on engine, component, generator, compressor hours.
    *   : Interface for planning tasks from other tables.
    *   **New/In Progress**: : Transferring closed failures, adding How was it solved? column, AI interaction to complete details.
2.  **AI Agent (Jessica):**
    *   Phase 1 (Implemented): Data analysis, suggestions, daily planning, pattern identification, leadership insights, *reading* from all tables.
    *   Phase 2 (Implemented): Ability to *write, update, and delete* records across all management tables, based on natural language commands.
    *   Phase 3 (Implemented): Asking the user How was it solved? when a failure is closed and transferring it to the new Solved Failures table.
3.  **Leadership Training Tables (3 tables):**
    *   : Documenting training meetings.
    *   : Defining leadership identity.
    *   : Progress tracking.

**Functional Requirements:** Daily status updates, planning assistance, pattern analysis, meeting preparation, clarifying questions, challenging thinking, updating conversation logs. Full Hebrew Right-to-Left (RTL) support, dynamic dashboard, multi-line chat input with memory. Integration with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.

**Success Metrics:** Yahel ready by September 18, 2025; saving 2-3 daily hours for Yahel; developing unique leadership identity; >90% soldier satisfaction.

AI prompt and action parsing logic updated for Jessica to ask how it was solved? and store information.
    -   **Recent Changes**: Integrated Google Calendar OAuth and API endpoints (models for  and , functions , , , ). Added , , . Integrated Push Notifications (VAPID key generation, Pydantic models for , new collections , , and endpoints , , ). AI prompt for Jessica was refined to specifically ask how long did it take?, who handled it?, and what to do in the future? and to correctly parse and apply  actions based on user's natural language responses.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables like , , .
    -   **Changes Made**:  added. , , and  were added for Google Calendar integration.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added ,  for Google Calendar, and , ,  for Push Notifications.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, structuring app layout, routing, global state management, and rendering tabs/AI chat.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include all 10 tables, AI chat, and data fetching for the dashboard.  was integrated. Added state variables and functions for Google Calendar integration (, , ). Integrated  component. Added new tabs for Google Calendar and Push Notifications. Modified mobile responsiveness classes and inline styles to improve tab display. Fixed bug where edit buttons were not functional: added  handlers to all edit buttons across various tables (Failures, Maintenances, Daily Plan, Equipment Hours, Conversations, DNA Tracker, 90-Day Plan), updated  functions to handle both add and edit operations, added  to populate forms with existing data when editing, and adjusted dialog titles/button texts for add/edit.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of debugging and fixing a critical white screen error reported by the user.

**Current State:**
*   **User Report:** אני רואה רק מסך לבן (I only see a white screen).
*   **AI's Diagnosis:**
    *   Checked backend                          RUNNING   pid 48, uptime 0:00:04
code-server                      RUNNING   pid 50, uptime 0:00:04
frontend                         STOPPED   Aug 14 03:53 PM
mongodb                          RUNNING   pid 56, uptime 0:00:04 to ensure backend and frontend services are running, which they were.
    *   Checked frontend logs () for errors, found no significant issues.
    *   Checked console logs via  which revealed a .
    *   The AI identified the root cause: an  hook was using the  state variable before it was properly initialized in . This likely occurred during the previous bug fix for the editing functionality where  was added to populate form data when editing.

The system is currently exhibiting a critical rendering issue (white screen) on the frontend, which the AI has successfully diagnosed to an initialization error in the  file. The problem statement ends with the AI having just identified this specific error and is poised to implement a fix.
